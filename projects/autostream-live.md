# Autostream Live introduction

[Autostream.Live](https://www.autostream.live/) is a web-tool for managing your media content using the cloud. Autostream.Live allows you to create live streams on the cloud in many different ways. By creating live streams on the cloud you won't have to worry about unreliable hardware or internet. 

## Offline Streaming

Choose the audio and the primary video/images (mp4, jpg, gif...), add overlay video/images and we process all of this internally then live stream from our servers!

## Multi-Service Streaming

Stream to Youtube, Twitch, Facebook Live, Tiktok and many others concurrently. We also support custom RTMP links!

## Desktop Cloud Streaming

Stream your desktop, specific windows, specific tabs, directly from your browser to any live streaming service that supports RTMP.
