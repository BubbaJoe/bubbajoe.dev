# RKX Introduction

RKX is a Module based API Gateway built in Go. It is designed to be a simple, fast, and extensible.

- Programmatic Modules in TypeScript or JavaScript
- Built-in support for:
  - Canary Deployments
  - Versioning
  - Certification Mappings
  
# RKX vs Kong

RKX utilizes similar high-level concepts as Kong:
- Routes
- Services
- Modules (Plugins)
- Clients (Consumers)

New concepts are also introduced:
- Namespaces


I plan to release the first version of rkx at the end of this year. I will be writing a series of blog posts about the design and implementation of rkx and the modules.
